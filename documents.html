    <p>Since my previous theology paper, <i>Unapologetic</i>, examines general arguments for the existence of God, I decided to write 
      a companion piece focussed on exploring specific reasons why I find Christianity to be the most compelling expression 
      of religious belief.
    </p>
    <p>Following the structure of William Lane Craig’s <i>Reasonable Faith</i>, the paper examines a few topics of systematic theology 
      that are effective at building a positive case for the truth of Christianity. By synthesising content from various sources, 
      including Jerry Walls and Trent Dougherty, Tim Mackie and Jon Collins, and N. T. Wright, I have been able to expand upon 
      the philosophical foundations presented by Craig, crafting more explicit and applicable arguments for Christian truth.

    <p>Raised with a traditional Christian upbringing, I became dissatisfied and unsettled during postsecondary education 
      when I was unable to express any particular reasons for my faith. Within STEM there is an expectation that professionals 
      should think and act rationally - my faith seemed to be in defiance of this principle, especially since I was unable 
      to rationalise any specific reasons for my belief in God at that time.
    </p>
    <p>In an attempt to justify the convictions of my personal faith, I began exploring various arguments for the existence 
      of God. Reading the works of authors like Richard Swinburne, Alvin Plantinga, Jerry Walls and Trent Doughtery, and C. 
      Stephen Evans helped me understand several of the traditional arguments for the existence of God, and inspired me to 
      begin studying philosophical topics.
    </p>
    <p>The paper is titled Unapologetic because whenever I told a classmate or colleague that I was religious, I always 
      felt as though a judgement was made upon my rationality, and that I should apologise for being silly. Even though my 
      postsecondary environment was very tolerant of religious perspectives, I wanted to be confident enough in my ability 
      to rationalise my faith that I would no longer feel the need to be apologetic about my convictions. The paper 
      rendered below is a condensed summary of several specific arguments for the existence of God which I find 
      personally compelling.

    <p>This is a paper written for a first year archaeology course; minor revisions have been made for privacy. 
      Although busy with other fourth year engineering courses, I was excited by the opportunity to write a research paper 
      exploring the Anglo Saxon lyre, and its cultural context. The freedom of my research was severely limited, as 
      the course assignment had a specific set of rubric criteria that I had to accommodate to achieve a reasonable 
      score. Nevertheless, I was excited to engage with the topic as creatively as possible within the bounds of 
      course requirements.
    </p>
    <p>The most significant contribution of the paper pertains to the distinction between "princely" and 
      "non-princely" burials. In its cultural context, the lyre functioned as a status symbol associated with the 
      elite warrior class, often included in princely burials as grave goods, though the deceased was not 
      necessarily a musician. By contrast, lyres in non-princely burials were frequently placed in close proximity 
      to the body, suggesting that the deceased may have been a "scop", the Anglo-Saxon counterpart to the 
      Scandinavian "skald".
    </p>
    <p>I believe this observation alone merits further exploration, as it addresses an underexplored aspect 
      of Anglo-Saxon funerary practices. While few scholarly sources delve into this subject in depth, it 
      presents a promising area for further research.

      <p>This is a paper written for a fourth year engineering course; minor revisions have been made for privacy. In the wake 
        of several large data breaches, my project group chose to focus our research on cybersecurity, and its impact on 
        personal privacy.
      </p>
      <p>After analysing legislative efforts in Canada, Europe, and the United States to enhance consumer protection 
        through data privacy laws, the paper shifts to a key discussion on the social and ethical responsibility of online 
        service providers to offer secure authentication systems for their users. It outlines a variety of key recommendations 
        including a re-evaluation of what constitutes a “secure” password, and standardisation of two factor authentication 
        systems.
      </p>
      <p>In the context of the attention economy, which commodifies consumer data to drive targeted advertising, the 
        topics of this paper—especially the social responsibility of corporations to protect the privacy of their 
        consumers—is of utmost importance. Hopefully this research inspires further discussion about the privacy rights 
        of consumers, and helps prompt investigation into alternate economic models that can address the issues of 
        surveillance capitalism.
